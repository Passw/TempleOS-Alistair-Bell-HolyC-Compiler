Program problems
=============
Logs the history and current defects within the program.
Fixes document the commit number and an optional message if wanted.
Each defect is separated into categories and are pretty self explanatory.
Misc is for anything not really codebase related.

Bugs
====
* Hash table on the language type proves to have too many collisions, new hash table implimentation required, or better hashing algorithm.

Quirks
======
* `hash_chars` gives to different values on a single char reference than a const char ptr.

Build errors
============
* Fails on openbsd, makefile uses some gnu make specific features - standardise to all unix make's.
Partial fix -> commit 42c61bce012a9bb5d410394aa0650a3ce337d5fc, compiles with gmake.
Full fix -> commit 2bcc50d3c20e075d7b4194e2519098c0eee03224, makefile posix compliant.

Crashes
=======
* Segfault on large files -> munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer. Possible issue with reallocation in src/parser.c: parser_add_token.
Fixed -> commit 060c4760adc4304ad1b2567137d032e1380128e9, check for buffer writes outside the 64 char limit.
* Segfault during lexer on files with no chars. Dataless files should skip the lexer entirely or fail the build.
